To set the cell font style to bold using `NPOI` (the .NET library that works with the HSSF and XSSF formats of Excel), you need to create a new cell style and font, apply the font to the style, and then apply the style to the cell.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```csharp
using NPOI.SS.UserModel;
using NPOI.XSSF.UserModel;
using NPOI.HSSF.UserModel;
using System.IO;

public void CreateExcelWithBoldCell(string filePath)
{
    // Create a new workbook and a sheet
    IWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook();
    ISheet sheet = workbook.CreateSheet("Sheet1");

    // Create a new row and a cell
    IRow row = sheet.CreateRow(0);
    ICell cell = row.CreateCell(0);
    cell.SetCellValue("Bold Text");

    // Create a new font and set it to bold
    IFont font = workbook.CreateFont();
    font.IsBold = true;

    // Create a new cell style and set the font
    ICellStyle style = workbook.CreateCellStyle();
    style.SetFont(font);

    // Apply the cell style to the cell
    cell.CellStyle = style;

    // Save the workbook to the file
    using (var fs = new FileStream(filePath, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
    {
        workbook.Write(fs);
    }

    workbook.Close();
}
```

In this example:
1. An `XSSFWorkbook` is created, which is suitable for .xlsx files. For .xls files, use `HSSFWorkbook` instead.
2. A new sheet and a row are created.
3. A new cell is created and set to contain the text "Bold Text".
4. A new font is created, and its `IsBold` property is set to `true`.
5. A new cell style is created, and the font is set to the style.
6. The cell style is applied to the cell.
7. The workbook is saved to the specified file path.

This will produce an Excel file with the first cell in the first row containing bold text. Adjust the example as needed to fit your specific use case.
