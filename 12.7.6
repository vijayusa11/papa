You need to add a JOIN with the `LeaveDetails` table and modify the `WHERE` clause to exclude timesheet entries that fall within the leave period. Here is the relevant part of the code to change:

### Adding the JOIN:
```sql
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' LEFT JOIN LeaveDetails AS ld ON t1.EmployeeId = ld.EmployeeId AND t1.TimesheetDate BETWEEN ld.FromDate AND ld.ToDate'
```

### Modifying the WHERE clause:
```sql
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' WHERE ld.LeaveId IS NULL AND 1=1'
```

### Full Code Snippet to Replace:
```sql
set @SELECT = 'SELECT   '	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.TimesheetId,'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.EmployeeId,'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.TimesheetDate,'	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.ProjectId,'	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.TimesheetStatusId,'	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	isnull(t1.TotalHours,0) TotalHours,'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	isnull(t1.TotalMins,0) TotalMins,'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	isnull(t1.Rate,0) Rate,'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	isnull(t1.TotalRate,0) TotalRate,'

set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.AuthoriserName,'

set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.CreatedDate AS CreatedDate, '
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	t1.SUBMITTEDDATE AS SubmittedDate '
	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	FROM TMS_Timesheets AS t1 '
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	INNER JOIN TMS_TimesheetStatuses AS t2 ON t1.TimesheetStatusId=t2.StatusId'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	INNER JOIN TMS_Projects AS t3 ON t1.ProjectId=t3.ProjectId'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	LEFT JOIN TMS_Practices AS t4 ON t1.PracticeId= t4.PracticeId'

set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	LEFT JOIN ProjectCategoryTypes AS pc on t3.ProjectCategoryId = pc.ProjectCategoryTypeID'
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	LEFT JOIN LeaveDetails AS ld ON t1.EmployeeId = ld.EmployeeId AND t1.TimesheetDate BETWEEN ld.FromDate AND ld.ToDate'
	
set @SELECT = @SELECT + ' 	WHERE ld.LeaveId IS NULL AND 1=1'
